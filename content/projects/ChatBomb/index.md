ChatBomb is a simple mod for Minecraft Fabric 1.14 (and Minecraft Forge 1.10 and 1.11).

This mod adds a block that's really a blast to use. It's just bursting with personality!

The 1.14 version of ChatBomb is a rewrite for Minecraft Fabric, and includes advancements and improved behavior (ChatBombs now explode through standard methods such as redstone and flint & steel).
