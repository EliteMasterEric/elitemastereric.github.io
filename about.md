## Career

I have been writing code for about 10 years now, and using computers for even longer. My first programming language was Java, where I basically just copied and pasted code I found in tutorials; once I actually took a class in Java and understood how objects and classes worked, and how variables and methods interacted, I was able to take on more interesting projects.

I am currently developing games using [Haxe](https://haxe.org/).
