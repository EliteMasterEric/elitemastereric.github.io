Obsidian Armor is a mod made to test the capabilities of various versions of Minecraft Fabric and Minecraft Forge.

It features Obsidian armor pieces and an Obsidian toolset. These use a new material type, Obsidian, which is slightly tougher than (but slightly less powerful than) Gold tools and armor.

The mod includes custom recipes, recipe book integration (collecting Obsidian adds all recipes to the recipe book), custom armor textures, a Creative mode inventory item group, and an advancement for equipping an Obsidian armor piece.
