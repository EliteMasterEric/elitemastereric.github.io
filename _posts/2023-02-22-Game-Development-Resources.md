## Game Engines

A game engine is a software framework with an associated set of tools, designed to facilitate the development of video games. Game engines are often designed to be cross-platform, and provide important basic functionality such as rendering, physics, sound, scripting, and asset management.

### Open Source Game Engines

These game engines are open source. They are not only free, but also provide full access to the engine's low-level code, allowing you to modify the engine to suit your needs (or even contribute to the engine's development).

Note that these engines often have difficulties with distribution on console platforms. This is because console platforms make their software development kits proprietary, and thus open source game engines cannot publicly publish tools for these platforms.

### Closed Source Game Engines

These game engines are closed source, and require a license to use. The license often allows free use for non-commercial projects, but requires a paid license for commercial projects. Additionally, the low-level code of these engines is kept highly proprietary, and is not accessible to the public.

**[Unity](https://unity.com/)**
